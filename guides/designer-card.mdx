Some specific things like a few component options are set on the Options Tab, but all of the styling itself gets done in the Designer Card. Here you'll find a detailed explanation of the Designer Card and its different areas. 

## All Designer Card Options:

| ![](/images/guides/image.png)               | Designer Card       | This is the whole Designer card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ![](/images/guides/image.png)               | Styling Tags        | With our builder, we **ALWAYS** style tags (CSS classes). So if the component you've selected doesn't have one, please "**Add a tag**" now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ![](/images/guides/image.png)               | Refining Selector   | You may want to set a **more specific selector**. You can specify it **by device** or even by different **parts of a component**. For example, you may want to style a button's image when viewed on a mobile device for a specific tag, but only on this page. By refining the selector, you'll be fine-tuning your styles.                                                                                                                |
| ![](/images/guides/2023-03-10_15h32_21.png) | Screen sizes        | Here you can choose on which kind of device (**screen size-related**) the styles you set are going to be applied. The default option is "**All devices**", which sets styles for computer screens. You can also choose "**Tablet**" or "**Mobile**".                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ![](/images/guides/image.png)               | \+ Sub-Element      | This dropdown will display a list of the **sub-elements** that the **selected component** has. From here, you can choose which specific sub-element you want to style.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ![](/images/guides/image.png)               | \+ Filter           | In the "**When**" dropdown you'll find options like "**hover**", "**disabled**", "**selected**", etc. The options you'll see are going to depend on the kind of component you have selected. Within the "**In**" dropdown, you'll be able to limit the **reach of your tag**. For example, you can select "**This page**" so that only the components with the tag you're styling and on this page would be affected by the styles you set. |
| ![](/images/guides/image.png)               | Card Tabs           | Tabs are **groups of CSS properties** that make it easier for you to find the property you want to set. Depending on the kind of component you have selected, you'll see a different set of tabs. Keep in mind that not all CSS properties can be applied to all kinds of elements.                                                                                                                                                         |
| ![](/images/guides/image.png)               | Custom Properties   | Not every **CSS property** is included on our tabs. If you want to use a **not-so-common property** and can't find it, you can always go to the last tab "**Custom**" and add any existing CSS property.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ![](/images/guides/image.png)               | Style Input Section | This is the Inputs area, which changes depending on the tab you have selected. In this image you can see the properties from the "**Size**" tab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
